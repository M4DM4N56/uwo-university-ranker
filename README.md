# uwo-university-ranker

This is a Western University project.

This project computes information from CSV files regarding each continent's countries, and each country's capital, and an international ranking of the top 100 univesities.

The program then executes a series of calculations, where it finds the best university in the selected country, weighs it against the continent average, and finds all the universities within that country's capital
